            <!-- Introduction -->
            <p class="intro-text">Congratulations! You've reached the final step in your home buying journey. Closing day (also called settlement day) is when you'll sign the final paperwork, pay closing costs, and officially take ownership of your new home. In Arizona, closings typically take place at a title company office, with all parties signing documents either together or separately.</p>

                    <p>At least three business days before closing, your lender will provide a Closing Disclosure detailing your final loan terms and closing costs. Review this document carefully and compare it to your Loan Estimate to identify any unexpected changes.</p>

                <p>Be extremely cautious about wire transfer instructions. Real estate transactions are targets for wire fraud. Always verify wire instructions by calling your escrow officer directly using a phone number you've independently confirmed. Never trust wire instructions sent via email without verbal confirmation.</p>

            <p>Closing costs typically range from 2-5% of the home's purchase price. Here's a breakdown of common closing costs in Arizona:</p>

                    <td>0-3% of loan amount</td>
                    <td>Optional fee paid to lower your interest rate (1 point = 1% of loan amount)</td>

                <h3>Escrow/Impound Accounts</h3>
                <p>Many lenders require escrow accounts for managing ongoing property taxes and insurance. At closing, you'll need to fund this account with several months of these expenses in advance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Property Taxes:</strong> Typically 2-6 months of taxes</li>
                    <li><strong>Homeowners Insurance:</strong> Often a full year's premium plus 2 months</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These aren't additional costs (you'd pay these expenses regardless), but they do increase your upfront cash needs at closing.</p>

                <p>When possible, schedule your closing for early in the morning. This provides buffer time for resolving any unexpected issues that arise and increases the likelihood that you'll receive keys the same day. Afternoon closings can be delayed until the next business day if there are complications or if wire transfers arrive too late for same-day processing.</p>

This removes the pressure of rushing through document reviews and gives you time to address any last-minute issues. It also allows you to begin moving or making immediate changes to your new home once you receive the keys.</p>
