            <p class="intro-text">While the home inspection process is taking place, your mortgage lender will be hard at work processing your loan application and ordering an appraisal. This phase typically runs concurrently with the inspection period but often extends beyond it, usually taking 30-45 days in total to complete.</p>

            <h2 class="section-subtitle">Understanding the Appraisal Process</h2>
            
            <p>The appraisal is a critical step in the mortgage process, as it verifies that the property is worth at least the amount you're paying:</p>
            
            <div class="two-column">
                <div>
                    <h3>What Is an Appraisal?</h3>
                    <p>An appraisal is an independent evaluation of a property's value conducted by a licensed appraiser. The appraiser will visit the property, take measurements and photos, and compare it to similar recently sold properties in the area.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cost:</strong> $450-$600 in the Tucson market</p>
                    <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Typically 5-10 business days after ordering</p>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <h3>Potential Appraisal Outcomes</h3>
                    <p><strong>At or Above Purchase Price:</strong> The loan proceeds as planned.</p>
                    <p><strong>Below Purchase Price:</strong> This creates an "appraisal gap" that must be addressed through one of these options:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Renegotiate the purchase price with the seller</li>
                        <li>Pay the difference out of pocket</li>
                        <li>Request a reconsideration of value (if appropriate)</li>
                        <li>Cancel the contract (if your appraisal contingency is still in effect)</li>
