            <div class="alert-box">
                <h3 class="alert-title"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Important Earnest Money Facts</h3>
                <p>Earnest money is a "good faith" deposit that demonstrates your commitment to the purchase. It becomes part of your down payment at closing but is at risk if you default on the contract.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="process-steps">
                <div class="step">
                    <div class="step-title">Amount</div>
                    <p>In the Tucson market, earnest money typically ranges from 1-2% of the purchase price. For a $400,000 home, that's $4,000-$8,000. The amount can be adjusted based on market competition.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="step">
                    <div class="step-title">Submission Timeline</div>
                    <p>You'll need to submit earnest money within 1-3 business days after offer acceptance. The escrow company will provide wire transfer or check instructions.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="step">
                    <div class="step-title">Protection</div>
                    <p>Contingencies in the contract (inspection, appraisal, financing) protect your earnest money. If you need to back out for a reason covered by these contingencies, you'll receive your deposit back.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="step">
                    <div class="step-title">Potential Risk</div>
                    <p>If you back out of the purchase for reasons not covered by contingencies, you could forfeit your earnest money to the seller. This is why proper contingencies are crucial.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="step">
                    <div class="step-title">Final Disposition</div>
                    <p>At closing, your earnest money is applied to your down payment and closing costs. It's not an additional expense but rather an advance payment.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h2 class="section-subtitle">Essential Contingencies</h2>
            
            <p>Contingencies protect you by allowing you to back out of the contract under specific circumstances. Here are the most important ones to include:</p>
            
            <div class="two-column">
                <div>
                    <h3>Inspection Contingency</h3>
                    <p>Gives you the right to have the property professionally inspected and to negotiate repairs or cancel the contract based on findings.</p>
                    <p><strong>Timeframe in Arizona:</strong> Typically 10 days</p>
                    <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Critical for discovering hidden issues</p>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <h3>Financing Contingency</h3>
                    <p>Protects you if your mortgage application is denied despite good faith efforts to secure financing.</p>
                    <p><strong>Timeframe in Arizona:</strong> Usually 30-45 days</p>
                    <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Essential unless paying cash</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="two-column">
                <div>
                    <h3>Appraisal Contingency</h3>
                    <p>Allows you to renegotiate or cancel if the property appraises for less than the offer price.</p>
                    <p><strong>Timeframe in Arizona:</strong> Typically within 30 days</p>
                    <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Protects you from overpaying</p>
                </div>
                
                <div>
                    <h3>Home Sale Contingency</h3>
                    <p>Makes your purchase contingent on selling your current home first.</p>
                    <p><strong>Timeframe in Arizona:</strong> Varies, often 30-60 days</p>
                    <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Optional but helpful if you need to sell first</p>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Can weaken offers in competitive markets</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Negotiation Strategy</h3>
                <p>This is where my expertise as your agent truly shines. I'll help you craft a winning offer by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Researching the seller's motivations (timeline, reason for selling, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Analyzing comparable sales to justify our offer price</li>
                    <li>Structuring contingencies to protect you while remaining competitive</li>
                    <li>Including personal touches (like a buyer letter in appropriate situations) to stand out</li>
                    <li>Negotiating for the seller to cover my commission, honoring my $1 promise to you</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Remember: The best offers balance competitiveness with protection.</p>

                <p>Before submitting an offer, contact your lender to get a property-specific pre-approval letter. This shows sellers you're serious and financially capable of completing the purchase. Many sellers won't consider offers without current pre-approval.</p>

                <p>In multiple-offer scenarios, an escalation clause automatically increases your offer to a specific amount above the highest competing offer, up to your maximum. This can be a powerful strategy in hot markets, allowing you to stay competitive without overpaying.</p>
